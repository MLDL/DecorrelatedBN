1. Download the magma from: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html (we use the version 2.0.2, I think other version should be OK)


2. Extract the files and choose a make.inc.* file depends on which BLAS you have installed(MKL, atlas, or OpenBlas). We use OpenBlas and how to install OpenBlas can be find later.
 
3.  Copy that file to make.inc, and modify it.

4. Some common configurations are listed here, for more information, please read the README file in the directorcy carefully.
          
	(1) export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda (depends on your real CUDA path) in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
    (2) export OPENBLASDIR=/opt/openblas (depends on your BLAS and its path) in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
      e.g.:  export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda-8.0
             export OPENBLASDIR=/home/huanlei/opt/openblas-0.2.18

       You can also do last 2 steps in the make.inc file.
5 run 'make' in the MAGMA directory.
6  run 'make install'  or 'sudo make install' in the same directory
